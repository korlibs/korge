This API is heavily influenced by the .NET Date and Time classes but adapted to best

Initially some parts of the api and date algorithms from .NET DateTime implementation released under MIT license were used:
- https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/d780f9a1327344bfc8e06737497b703cdbfba804/src/mscorlib/shared/System/DateTime.cs

As for 1.0, all the relevant code has been rewritten from scratch.
