/**
 * Acts as a controller. Subclasses must override at least one of: [sceneInit] or [sceneMain].
 *
 * The lifecycle of the [Scene] for ([SceneContainer.pushTo], [SceneContainer.changeTo], [SceneContainer.back], [SceneContainer.forward]):
 *
 * - ## OLD Scene -> NEW Scene -- Scene is changed
 * - NEW: [sceneInit] - BLOCK - Called when this scene enters. Waits until completed
 * - NEW: [sceneMain] - DO NOT BLOCK - Called after [sceneInit]. Doesn't wait for completion. Its underlying Job is closed automatically on [sceneAfterDestroy]
 * - OLD: [sceneBeforeLeaving] - BLOCK - Called on the old scene. Waits until completed.
 * - Transition from the old view and the new view is performed the animation transition set values for [View.ratio] in the [SceneContainer.transitionView] in the range 0..1
 * - OLD: [sceneDestroy] - BLOCK - Called when this scene exits. Waits until completed.
 * - OLD: [sceneAfterDestroy] - DO NOT BLOCK - Cancels the [Job] of the old scene. Do not wait
 * - NEW: [sceneAfterInit] - DO NOT BLOCK - Similar to [sceneMain] but after the transition.
 * - ## New scene is returned
