/**
 * A context that allows to render objects.
 *
 * The [RenderContext] contains the [ag] [AG] (Accelerated Graphics),
 * that allow to render triangles and other primitives to the current render buffer.
 *
 * When doing 2D, you should usually use the [batch] to buffer vertices,
 * so they can be rendered at once when flushing.
 *
 * If you plan to do a custom drawing using [ag] directly, you should call [flush],
 * so all the pending vertices are rendered.
 *
 * If you want to perform drawing using a context allowing non-precomputed transformations
 * you can use [ctx2d].
 *
 * If you need to get textures from [Bitmap] that are allocated and deallocated as required
 * preventing leaks, you should use [getTex].
