KorGE uses the [Virtual File Systems from Korio](/io/) to load resources from different sources,
and its most basic resources are [Bitmaps](/imaging/) and [Sounds](/audio/).
But it can also load bitmap fonts, tiled maps, etc.

## `KR`

Since KorGE 4.0.3, there is a new autogenerated class called `KR`. This is similar to Android `R`,
and provides a type-safe way of accessing resources. It exposes all the files in the resources folder,
and provides reading shortcuts for images and sounds. In the case of folders ended with `.atlas` it generates
automatically an optimized atlas of the images, and provides a way to access them.

KorGE IntelliJ plugin will also display previews for files and atlases:

![](/i/KR.avif)

You can see it in action in the KorGE youtube channel with the [KorGE Chess tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSK7ruZbam0&list=PLzb5P1l-LxelGV8bWyT7tnLsF96MQxqCM&index=4).

## resourcesVfs

KorIO offers a `resourcesVfs` global property that holds a Virtual File System that include the
files from `src/commonMain/resources` in all the targets.

## ResourcesRoot

With the injector, or as part of the `Scene` class, you have access to a `ResourcesRoot` instance.
It is a MoutableVfs, where the `resourcesVfs` is mounted at `/`.
This allows you to load resources from different sources like a cache folder, or a base URL.

## Resources

KorGE supports directly or indirectly several kind of resources.

### Bitmaps

You can read bitmaps with:

```kotlin
resourcesVfs["relative/path/to/image.png"].readBitmap()
```

All the targets support at least `PNG` and `JPEG` bitmap loading.

### Sound and Music

You can read sound files with:

```kotlin
resourcesVfs["relative/path/to/sound.mp3"].readSound()
```

All targets support `WAV` and `MP3`.
