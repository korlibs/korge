Note that currently **KorGE is focused on 2D game development**.
Even when KorAG allows you to render 3d objects and scenes, you won't have help from the engine.

If you have a 2D game done with Unity, KorGE is a good engine to move to!

You will get the productivity and tooling of the Kotlin programming language. And you will use an OpenSource engine that you can check, understand and fix possible bugs.
Also KorGE do not enforce any kind of programming strategy. So you can use your own.
